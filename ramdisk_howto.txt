Creating a RAMDISK on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is really easy. All required tools  are already pre-installed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

First create a mount point where you will be mounting the RAMDISK with the following command:

sudo mkdir /mnt/ramdisk

Now you can mount the RAMDISK to the /mnt/ramdisk mount point with the following command:

$ sudo mount -t tmpfs -o rw,size=2G tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk

NOTE: Here, size=2G means, the RAMDISK will be 2 GB in size. To create RAMDISK of several MB, use M. For example, to create 512 MB RAMDISK, put size=512M

$ sudo mount -t tmpfs -o rw,size=512M tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk

Now to verify whether the RAMDISK is created, run the following command:

$ df -h

As you can see, the RAMDISK is created and mounted on /mnt/ramdisk as expected:
tmpfs                      199M     28K  199M    1% /run/user/1000
tmpfs                      512M       0  512M    0% /mnt/ramdisk
